## Installation
<details> <summary>Steps</summary>

1. Install BepInEx, which is required for modding VRising. Follow the instructions provided at [BepInEx Installation Guide](https://wiki.vrisingmods.com/user/bepinex_install.html) to set it up correctly in your VRising game directory.
   - **Note:** Until BepInEx is updated for 1.1, please do not use the thunderstore version. Get the correct testing version https://wiki.vrisingmods.com/user/game_update.html.

2. Download the KindredCommands mod along with its dependencies (VCF). Ensure you select the correct versions that are compatible with your game.
   - **Note:** Again, until dependencies are updated for 1.1, please do not use the thunderstore version. Get the correct testing version https://wiki.vrisingmods.com/user/game_update.html.

3. After downloading, locate the .dll files for KindredCommands and its dependencies. Move or copy these .dll files into the `BepInEx\Plugins` directory within your VRising installation folder.

   - **Single Player Note:**
     - If you are playing in single player mode, you will need to install [ServerLaunchFix](https://thunderstore.io/c/v-rising/p/Mythic/ServerLaunchFix/). This is a server-side mod that is essential for making the commands work properly on the client side. Make sure to download and place it in the same `BepInEx\Plugins` directory.

4. Launch the Game: Start VRising. If everything has been set up correctly, KindredCommands should now be active in the game.

- **Using Commands:** The commands for KindredCommands go into the chat box, not the console. However, players will first need to authenticate themselves in the console chat. You can find instructions on how to do this [here](https://wiki.vrisingmods.com/user/Using_Server_Mods.html).
